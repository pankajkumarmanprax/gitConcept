Problem:
Wiki image upload functionality not working.


Reason:
-(devx:Htmleditor) use App_Data folder as a intermediate between actual folder.
-slice down image file and send it to sharepoint hive in multiple bits to avoid chance of crash .

-"AdvancedModeSettings.TemporaryFolder" to set  temp folder.


-temp folder should have all read ,right,overwight access .



solution:

-make a App_Data/UploadImages folder in Sharepoint hive with full read right access.
-map it to Site.
-now specify whaterver path for storing image it will work fine.

e.g:-

<SettingsImageUpload UseAdvancedUploadMode="true"  UploadImageFolder="~/_layouts/15/images/uGovernIT/UploadedFiles/">


.....now everthing is done it stat working


flaws:
-we have to hardcode the folder and its perrmissions manually.
